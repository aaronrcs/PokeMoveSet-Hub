# PokeMoveSet-Hub

__Idea/Inspiration behind this project:__

  -As a long time fan of the Pokemon franchise, I decided to make a fun web application that allows users to provide recommended move-sets for certain Pokemon. It can either be for the casual run throughs of the main series games, or a user can provide a move-set that is suitable for competitive play.
